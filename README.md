# Flappy-Bird-Game
A simple and fun Flappy Bird clone developed in C# using Windows Forms. This project is a desktop application designed to mimic the classic Flappy Bird gameplay, where players control a bird trying to navigate through a series of pipes without crashing. It's a great example of basic game development concepts using Windows Forms.

# Features
- Engaging Gameplay: Classic Flappy Bird mechanics with a smooth gaming experience.
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of your score as you progress.
- Easy Controls: Use the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings.
- Customizable Assets: Modify the game's graphics or sounds to create your own version.

# Purpose
This project serves as:
- A fun game to play.
- A learning resource for beginners in C# who are interested in game development using Windows Forms.
- A starting point for enhancing and customizing small game projects.

# How It Works
- The bird is controlled using the spacebar key, which makes it flap upward.
- Gravity pulls the bird downward when itâ€™s not flapping.
- Pipes move from right to left, and the goal is to avoid hitting them.
- The game ends if the bird crashes into a pipe or the ground.
